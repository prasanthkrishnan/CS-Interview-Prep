A Domain Name System (DNS) translates a domain name such as www.example.com to an IP address.

- DNS is hierarchical
- Your router or ISP provides information about which DNS server(s) to contact when doing a lookup
- Lower level DNS servers cache mappings, sometimes OS and browser also cache dns mappings with a TTL.

title Basic DNS resolution
actor client
client -> "ISP DNS server" as ISP : www.google.com
ISP -> "Root DNS server" as Root : www.google.com
Root -> ISP : "192.168.1.10"
note right: stores it in cache
ISP -> client : "192.168.1.10"
client --> "192.168.1.10" as Google : /index.html
Google --> client : /index.html

** DNS domain names

** Resource Records
- *NS record (name server)* - Specifies the authoratative DNS servers for your domain/subdomain.
- *MX record (mail exchange)* - Specifies the mail servers for accepting messages.
- *A record (address)* - Points a name to an IP address.
- *CNAME (canonical)* - Points a name to another name or CNAME (example.com to www.example.com) or to an A record.

** DNS Queries
There are two types of DNS queries: i.e Iterative and Recursive

The figure shows a number of queries were used to determine the IP address for www.whitehouse.gov. The query sequence is described as follows:
- Recursive query for www.whitehouse.gov (A resource record)
- Iterative query for www.whitehouse.gov (A resource record)
- Referral to the .gov name server (NS resource records, for .gov); for simplicity, iterative A queries by the DNS server (on the left) to resolve the IP addresses of the Host names of the name server’s returned by other DNS servers have been omitted.
- Iterative query for www.whitehouse.gov (A resource record)
- Referral to the whitehouse.gov name server (NS resource record, for whitehouse.gov)
- Iterative query for www.whitehouse.gov (A resource record)
- Answer to the iterative query from whitehouse.gov server (www.whitehouse.gov’s IP address)
- Answer to the original recursive query from local DNS server to resolver (www.whitehouse.gov’s IP address)
