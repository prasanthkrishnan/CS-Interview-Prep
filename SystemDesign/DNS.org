A Domain Name System (DNS) translates a domain name such as www.example.com to an IP address.

- DNS is hierarchical
- Your router or ISP provides information about which DNS server(s) to contact when doing a lookup
- Lower level DNS servers cache mappings, sometimes OS and browser also cache dns mappings with a TTL.

** DNS domain names

** Resource Records
- *NS record (name server)* - Specifies the authoratative DNS servers for your domain/subdomain.
- *MX record (mail exchange)* - Specifies the mail servers for accepting messages.
- *A record (address)* - Points a name to an IP address.
- *CNAME (canonical)* - Points a name to another name or CNAME (example.com to www.example.com) or to an A record.

** DNS Queries
