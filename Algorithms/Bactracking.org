* What is Backtracking?
Backtracking is a technique for listing all possible solutions for a combinatorial problem. It is a systematic way to iterate through all the possible configurations of a search space. These configurations may represent all possible arrangementsof objects (permutations) or all possible ways of building a collection of them(subsets). It finds all (or some) solutions to combinatorial problems, by incrementally building candidates to the valid solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.
